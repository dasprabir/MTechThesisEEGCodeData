# Abstract
Our brain consists of more than 10 billion neurons which are physically arranged over
several dimensions of space and functionally interacting across numerous scales of time.
Different groups of neurons in our brain are functionally linked and correlated and it has
a substantial impact on cognition, behaviour, and general brain dynamics. In this thesis,
different phase synchronization and power connectivity methods are demonstrated after
time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals obtained from task-related and resting-
state experiments. Frequency domain analysis was done to extract power and phase
information using complex Morlet wavelet convolution. Phase-based Synchronization
is an important mechanism by which different neural population transmit and process
information. Inter-Trail Phase Clustering (ITPC), Inter-Site Phase Clustering (ISPC),
Phase Lag Index (PLI) are chosen for phase-based connectivity measures and amplitude
time series analysis, cross-frequency coupling are selected to analyse power-based con-
nectivity measures. Also, hub and hubness constructed and small world characteristics
of brain are interpreted and analyzed using graph theory. Finally, brain-behaviour cor-
relation is performed using within subject cross-trial multiple regression to test whether
EEG power is associated with some measure of behaviour.
